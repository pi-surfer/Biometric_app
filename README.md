# Biometric_app

Flutter App which aims at fulfilling target 2.3 of the UN Sustainable Development Goals using biometric data from a smart watch.

THE IDEA: The app, called "Fit2Seed", defines some daily fit goals (taking into account the literature about the benefits of the physical activity on the cardiovascular system) in order to provide credits to the user when they are achieved. The goals' progresses are related to the biometric data recorded with a smartwatch. Then the user can use these credits to support a local farmer and other small local realities in turn of some discounts at their shops.

The financial support that corresponds to each credit is provided by partner companies which are advertised within the app. Therefore, partner companies can build a stronger relationship with the user of the app collaborating in supporting local realities, and along side providing a green and socially-active image of themselves. The user can answer to a moral need and they receive discounts. The farmers receive financing.

THE APP: The app is able to save and retrieve data from a database, to use them in order to compute the progress state of each goal, to show the progresses to the user, to advertise local realities and partner companies. The user is asked to create an account with ID and password and to log in.

This project is part of the "Biomedical Wearable Technologies for Healthcare and Wellbeing" class, Bioengineering Master, University of Padua.
